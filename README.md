This is the piece of work I submitted for the practical assignment for the Principles of Programming module during my first year at university. 


The assignment brief was as follows:

*The software must be designed using principles of good user interface design and should be
developed with the user (Key Stage 1 pupil) in mind. It should enable the user to:
- Browse websites
  - *Type in URL and visit the web page (created using HTML)
  - *Go backwards and forwards through the pages visited during that session
  - *Refresh a web page

- *Perform simple arithmetic sums
  - *Adding
  - *Dividing
  - *Subtracting
  - *Multiplication

- *Writing
  - *Writing simple passages of text
  - *Change fonts and text size
  - *Change font colour
  - *Save and open text documents (.txt files)

I received 86/100 for this assignment, which I was pleased with as this was my first project using Java, but I could have scored higher if my code was annotated better.
